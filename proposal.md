# External Scanning
> Excel: too manual, hard to use

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> Yearly, specialists will do stock-take and will need to generate a report on the existing stock.
> In training sessions where equipment is needed, specialists will have to loan out items and return them after session is over
> Some items may be stored in  armoury, then be removed to be given out to CCA members
